# Validation Reports

This folder contains focused validation reports for the AWS AgentCore Enterprise Toolkit. These reports summarize what we audited, the evidence gathered from the repository, and clear next steps.

- best-practices.md — CIS-aligned and AWS-recommended best practices mapping: what applies, what’s covered here, and what’s out-of-scope for this template (organization-level controls).
- orphan-audit.md — Producer/consumer mapping for SSM parameters and other shared artifacts to detect potential orphans.

Each report is concise, evidence-based, and strictly functional (no automation or how-to cleanups).
